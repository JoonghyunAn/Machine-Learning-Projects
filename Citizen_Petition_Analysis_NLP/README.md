# Citizen Petition Analysis NLP

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing citizen petitions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the text data, providing a deeper understanding of the issues and concerns raised by citizens.

## Project Structure
- **citizen_petition.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the project.
- **datasets/**: Folder containing the dataset used for analysis. Not uploaded due to file size.
- **models/**: Folder containing trained models and relevant artifacts. Not uploaded due to file size.

## Dependencies
To run the project, you'll need the following Python libraries. Remeber that this is a NLP on Korean language, so dependencies may vary:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `torch`
- `gensim`
- `word2vec`
- `konply`

## Methodology
The project follows these steps:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis.

- Feature Extraction: Extracting features from the text data using NLP techniques.

- Model Training: Training machine learning models to analyze and classify the petitions.

- Results and Insights: Evaluating the models and extracting insights from the analysis.

## Results
The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the citizen petitions, highlighting key issues and concerns. The trained models can be used to classify new petitions and predict their categories.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of NLP techniques to analyze citizen petitions, providing valuable insights and aiding in the understanding of public concerns.
