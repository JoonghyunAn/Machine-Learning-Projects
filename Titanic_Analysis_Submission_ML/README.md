# Titanic Analysis Submission ML

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset and creating a machine learning model to predict passenger survival. The primary goal of this project was to practice and familiarize myself with the Kaggle system, including dataset handling, submission, and competition participation.

## Project Structure
- **titanic.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the project. It used scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier to get the prediction result. 
- **titanic_eda.ipynb**: EDA for titnaic data. It gives a good overview of the data.
- **submission.csv**: Results of survival prediction

## Dependencies
To run the project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`


## Methodology
The project follows these steps:

- Data Loading: Loading the Titanic dataset.

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand its structure and key characteristics.

- Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting features for the model.

- Model Training: Training machine learning models to predict passenger survival.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance on a validation dataset.

- Kaggle Submission: Preparing and submitting predictions to Kaggle for evaluation.

- Results
The trained model provides predictions for passenger survival based on the given features. The project demonstrates the process of participating in a Kaggle competition and using machine learning techniques for predictive analysis.

## Conclusion
This project was conducted as a practice exercise to learn and navigate the Kaggle system. It provides a foundational understanding of data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and submission processes in a competitive environment.
