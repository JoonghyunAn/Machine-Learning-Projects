    "### RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) practice \n",
    "- Retrieval -Find relevant information given a query\n",
    "- Augmentation -Take the relevant information from retrieval and augment our input(prompt) to an LLM with that relevant information.\n",
    "- Generation - Take the first two steps and pass them to an LLM for generative outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why RAG?\n",
    "- The main goal of RAG is to improve the generation outputs of LLMs. \n",
    "- Most of what I practiced were based on fine-tuning. It can provide up-to-date information to the model with less efforts.\n",

       "  'text': \"7  1.2 Virginia Tech Graduate Honor Code    The Graduate Honor Code establishes a standard of academic integrity. As such, this code  demands a firm adherence to a set of values. In particular, the code is founded on the concept  of honesty with respect to the intellectual efforts of oneself and others. Compliance with the  Graduate Honor Code requires that all graduate students exercise honesty and ethical behavior  in all their academic pursuits at Virginia Tech, whether these undertakings pertain to study,  course work, research, extension, or teaching.  It is recognized that graduate students have very diverse cultural backgrounds. In light of this,  the term ethical behavior is defined as conforming to accepted professional standards of  conduct, such as codes of ethics used by professional societies in the United States to regulate  the manner in which their professions are practiced. The knowledge and practice of ethical  behavior shall be the full responsibility of the student. Graduate students may, however, consult  with their major professors, department heads, International Graduate Student Services, or the  Graduate School for further information on what is expected of them.  More specifically, all graduate students, while being affiliated with Virginia Tech, shall abide by  the standards established by Virginia Tech, as described in this Constitution. Graduate  students, in accepting admission, indicate their willingness to subscribe to and be governed by  the Graduate Honor Code and acknowledge the right of the University to establish policies and  procedures and to take disciplinary action (including suspension or expulsion) when such action  is warranted. Ignorance shall be no excuse for actions which violate the integrity of the  academic community.  The fundamental beliefs underlying and reflected in the Graduate Honor Code are that (1) to  trust in a person is a positive force in making a person worthy of trust, (2) to study, perform  research, and teach in an environment that is free from the inconveniences and injustices  caused by any form of intellectual dishonesty is a right of every graduate student, and (3) to live  by an Honor System, which places a positive emphasis on honesty as a means of protecting  this right, is consistent with, and a contribution to, the University's quest for truth.   For additional requirements and further information, please refer to the on-line information on  Graduate Honor System and the Honor Code contained on the Virginia Tech Graduate School  website at this link.  1.3 Diversity and Inclusion Requirement  The ECE Department is committed to fostering a diverse community of faculty, staff, and  students. The Virginia Tech Graduate School’s Office of Recruitment, Diversity, and Inclusion  focuses on graduate student recruitment and on providing support to students as they get  acclimated and adjusted to their graduate programs/certificates through the development of  inclusive and diverse programming to meet students' needs. In addition, the ECE Department  works closely with the College of Engineering’s Graduate Diversity Programs to help facilitate  programs designed specifically for graduate students. More information about the diversity and  inclusion efforts at the Graduate School levels may be found on-line at this link.  The Graduate School requires all students receiving a graduate degree to satisfy Inclusion and  Diversity Requirement. ECE graduate students satisfy this requirement by enrolling and passing  the course ENGE 5304, Graduate Student Success in Multicultural Environments (GSSME),  which must appear on each ECE graduate student’s plan of study.\"},\n",

In addition, all ECE graduate students are expected to  uphold the Virginia Tech Principles of Community and the Graduate School’s Expectations for  Graduate Education as well as the scholarly integrity and research ethics standards of their  disciplines. To satisfy this requirement, ECE graduate students must:  •  Attend the mandatory ECE Graduate Student Orientation held for their first semester of  enrollment as an ECE graduate student  •  Enroll and pass the fall semester of ECE 5944, Graduate Seminar  •  Successfully complete the NSF Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) requirement  as implemented at Virginia Tech.  Additional details on the ECE requirements for satisfying the Scholarly Ethics and Integrity  training requirement is given at the Graduate School’s website at this link.    1.5 Expectations for Graduate Education    The ECE Department supports the Virginia Tech Graduate School’s expectations for graduate  students, graduate program faculty, academic departments and programs, and the Graduate  School at Virginia Tech across all the university's campuses. The ECE Department is committed  to ensuring that these expectations are upheld by all. The Virginia Tech Graduate School’s  expectations document is available at this link.  1.6 Graduate Ombudsperson  The Ombudsperson for the Graduate School helps members of the Graduate School community  engage in and manage conflict in a constructive way. More information about the Graduate  Ombudsperson may be found at this link.  1.7 Conflict Resolution for ECE Graduate Students  If an ECE graduate student encounters a problem or a concern that cannot be resolved with  their advisor, or in an ECE course (e.g., a grading issue), or with interactions within their  research group, there is a “chain of command” to follow. This chain of command should be  followed to help in the resolution of conflict or outstanding issues that may arise as part of your  graduate education within ECE at Virginia Tech. The order is the following:  1. Your first point of contact is your academic advisor  2. The second point of contact is the ECE Graduate Program Director  3. If and only if you are unable to resolve your concern with (1) and (2), the third point of  contact within ECE is the ECE Department Head  4. Issues or concerns not resolved by consulting these three ECE points of contact should  be brought to the Dean of the Graduate School  5. In parallel with consulting the Graduate School Dean, for an independent advocate, you  may also contact the Graduate School Ombudsperson.\"},\n",

The Graduate  Advising Office will not proceed with the requested change without such approval. A change of  degree program can be requested only after the first semester of enrollment and the student  must have at least 9 graded course credit hours and a minimum 3.3 overall GPA. Note that  Graduate School policy allows a student to change graduate degree only once. M.S. thesis and  Ph.D. students funded at any time by a Graduate Teaching Assistantship (GTA) are not eligible  to change to the M.Eng. or M.S. non-thesis degree. M.S. thesis and Ph.D. students funded by a  Graduate Research Assistantship (GRA) must have faculty advisor’s approval to the M.Eng. or  M.S., Non-thesis, degree. The Graduate School also requires that change of degree programs  be requested prior the completion of 21 graded course credit hours. Detailed information on  changing from any ECE Master’s degree to another ECE graduate degree is given here.  1.9 Petitions to the ECE Graduate Committee   This ECE Graduate Policy Manual includes the policies and procedures for ECE graduate  degree programs. In exceptional cases, a student may have legitimate reasons for deviating  from these general requirements. In such cases, the student may submit a petition to the ECE  Graduate Committee to request special consideration.   1.10 Minimum Registration for Students on Assistantships  All graduate students who are supported by a teaching or research assistantship must be  enrolled for some combination of coursework, research, or independent study totaling at least  12 credit hours during the semester they are funded.  1.11 English Proficiency for Teaching Assistants   The duties of graduate teaching assistants in ECE often include direct instructional contact.  Therefore, international students whose native language is not English may have to pass an  English Speaking Proficiency Evaluation in order to be eligible for a graduate teaching  assistantship in ECE. More information is available at this link.  1.12 Immigration Advising  International students should consult directly with Cranwell International Center for guidance  related to: Immigration: I-20/Visa immigration documents; maintaining immigration status; CPT  and OPT applications; and reduced credit enrollment. For more information, consult the on-line  resources available at this link.   1.13 ECE Graduate Student Forms and their Submission    ECE graduate students must obtain department-level approval on all requests and forms that  are submitted to the Virginia Tech Graduate School.

The M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs are offered through the Blacksburg campus as well as the  extended campus consortia (National Capital Region, Northern Virginia Center, Falls Church,  Virginia; Central; Hampton Roads; Western; Virtual; and VT-MENA through Alexandria and  Cairo, Egypt). The M.Eng. degree is offered at the National Capital Region (NCR) and Virtual  campuses.  The ECE Department offers both an M.S., Thesis, and an M.S., Non-Thesis, degree. For the  M.S., Thesis, degree, each plan of study is developed by the student in consultation with his or  her faculty advisor satisfying the M.S., Thesis, degree requirements and the defense of a thesis.  The M.S., Non-Thesis, degree is a coursework-based master’s degree. The M.Eng. degree is a  professionally-oriented degree that offers graduate students a strong academic foundation in  core ECE technological areas with a culminating, project-based learning experience.  The Ph.D. is the highest academic degree awarded by the university and is conferred upon  students who demonstrate outstanding original scholarship during advanced study. It signifies  that the student can conduct independent research and has both a broad basic knowledge of all  areas of the field and a comprehensive knowledge of one area. Students applying for the Ph.D.  program typically have a master’s degree from an accredited college or university in EE, CPE,  or a related field.  A direct-Ph.D. option is available for students without an earned master’s degree. These  students will earn an M.S., Thesis, or an M.S., Non-Thesis, degree in addition to the Ph.D.  degree.  2.2 Admission to the M.S. and Ph.D. Degree Programs    Admission to the M.S., Ph.D., or Direct Ph.D. programs requires the submission of the following  materials:  •  Completion of the on-line application found at the Graduate School website   •  An up-to-date, electronic copy of all official transcript(s) must be submitted with the on- line application; please do not mail your official transcripts to the Graduate School until  you have received an offer of admission from Virginia Tech  •  Three (3) on-line letters of recommendation from people familiar with the student's  academic and/or work background  •  The Graduate Record Exam (the GRE general test including the verbal, quantitative, and  writing) is optional for all applicants; however, applicants with a lower GPA, or from a  school from which Virginia Tech ECE may not be familiar, may benefit from providing  strong GRE scores  •  The TOEFL or IELTS exam is required for applicants not earning a degree from an  accredited university where English is the language of instruction  •  A resume and a statement of purpose submitted with the on-line application  •  A nonrefundable application fee of $75.00.\"},\n",

Grade Point Average (GPA) requirements for admission status are generally higher than  for electrical and computer engineering graduates.    Students from programs such as physics, mathematics, computer science, engineering (other  than electrical or computer), and other programs usually lack background in areas of work  required of electrical and computer engineering students.    Each student's remedial course requirements must be assessed on an individual basis. The  exact nature of courses which a student may need should be decided by the student and his or  her interim advisor. Students crossing from CPE to EE or EE to CPE may also require additional  undergraduate (or MS level) course work. Typical needs are the following:      BACHELOR'S DEGREE  BACKGROUND  TYPICAL REQUIRED COURSE WORK GROUPS  (SEE TABLES BELOW FOR COURSES RELATED TO  EACH GROUP.)

However, these courses, if  taken at Virginia Tech, will be counted by the Graduate School toward a student's overall grade point  average (GPA). These courses may be taken concurrently with graduate level EE/CPE courses,  assuming prerequisites are met.    Students seeking a graduate degree in ECE with a bachelor’s degree in a discipline other than EE or  CPE (or changing from EE to CPE or CPE to EE) should have or obtain a background equivalent to the  following Virginia Tech undergraduate courses.\"}]"

Students must enroll  in Project and Report/Thesis/Dissertation by the CRN number assigned to their interim faculty  advisor or faculty advisor. Students are required to inform the faculty if enrolled in one of their  CRN numbers to determine the requirements and faculty expectations to earn a passing (EQ)  grade. These credit hours are not to be viewed as filler but rather a commitment to a certain  research load as mutually agreed upon by the student and faculty advisor.    Once an applicant registers, the application materials become part of the student's educational  record. ECE faculty and staff are allowed to access graduate student's educational files for  consideration of advising and research funding. Under the Family Education Rights and Privacy  Act (FERPA) of 1974, a student has the right to waive this access. To do so please comply in  writing to the ECE Graduate Advising Office.  3.5 Special Policies for ECE Graduate Course Work    In the following subsection, the ECE graduate program’s special policies on course registration  for all graduate degrees is detailed.  3.5.1 Graduate Seminar, ECE 5944  The ECE Seminar course, ECE 5944, is one-credit hour and is intended for new ECE on- campus and extended campus M.S. and Ph.D. graduate students. Research and engineering  activities in many areas of current interest to electrical and computer engineers are presented  by invited lecturers. The seminar course is Zoom-based and offered at the Blacksburg campus,  Northern Virginia Center (NCR), and all other campuses.  For all first-year graduate students (MS and PhD), attendance at all seminars is mandatory.  Students failing to attend all seminars in each semester shall receive an F on their transcript  which will be included in a student's overall GPA. If assigned duties or other time conflicts  interfere with a regularly scheduled seminar, students must submit a written request in advance  of a seminar for an excused seminar absence to the Graduate Seminar Instructor. The seminar  course is taken on a Pass/Fail basis and is included on the plan of study. Additionally, graduate  students are also expected to attend seminars in their specialty area(s) within the department.  3.5.2 Cross-Listed Courses   Cross-listed courses are courses that are listed in the course catalogs of more than one  department. ECE graduate students should register for the ECE version of ECE courses cross- listed with other departments.   3.5.3 Co-located and Conjoined Undergraduate/Graduate Courses  Several ECE courses are co-located or are conjoined. ECE graduate students should register  for the graduate version of these courses and cannot receive credit for both courses on their  plan of study. A table, not necessarily exhaustive, for these courses is given below. Students  with any questions about this policy should contact their Academic Advisor.\",\n",

The advantage of the program is that it allows enrolled students to double-count up  to 12 course credit hours (with the restrictions listed below) toward both degrees.  Virginia Tech undergraduate students who have a minimum GPA of 3.3 or better on all  undergraduate work, may apply for admission to the Accelerated ECE UGG Degree program. A  student may enter the program within the 12-month time period prior to the expected completion  date of their BS degree. To receive graduate credit, acceptance into the Accelerated UGG  Degree program is required prior to the semester in which enrolled in the courses selected for  double-counting.  Once accepted to the program, and during the last two semesters of their  undergraduate program, students may count a maximum of 12 credit hours of course work  toward both the BS and graduate degrees.     A complete application for the ECE UGG program must include the following:  1. A submitted on-line graduate application for ECE graduate studies at Virginia Tech at  this link. The application must include the following:  •  Apply for an ECE graduate degree program (MEng, MS, or PhD) in EE or CPE for  the semester/year after you plan to complete your BS degree. For example, if I were  planning to graduate with my BS in spring 2024, I would apply for the ECE graduate  degree for fall 2024 by the May 15, 2023, or December 15, 2023, deadline.  •  Two on-line letters of recommendation are required for the application; typically, one  of these letters is from the proposed faculty advisor.  •  Students applying for this program are not required to take the GRE for admission.  •  Payment of a $75.00 non-refundable Graduate School application fee.     2. A completed “Accelerated Undergraduate/Graduate Degree and Course Designation  Status Form” detailing the courses to be doubled counted for both the undergraduate  and graduate degree programs. This form is available on the Graduate School’s forms  website  at this link, where it can be found under the “Admissions” section.  •  To apply for the Accelerated ECE UGG Degree program, you will need an “Advisor’s  Signature” on the form submitted to the Graduate School. The advisor will depend on  the degree to which you are applying.   •  MEng: For the MEng degree, the MEng Graduate Program Director will sign as  the advisor.  •  MS Non-Thesis: For the MS Non-Thesis degree the MS Non-Thesis Graduate  Program Director will sign as the advisor.  •  MS Thesis or PhD: For the MS Thesis or PhD degrees, an ECE graduate faculty  member must have agreed to serve as faculty advisor for the student’s graduate  degree. The student should work with their faculty advisor to develop a Research  Statement to be submitted as their Statement of Purpose with their graduate  application. This faculty advisor will sign the form.  •  The completed form must be submitted your ECE Undergraduate Academic &  Career Advisor, simultaneously with submission of the on-line graduate application. If  there are any subsequent changes to the courses to be double-counted, an updated  form must be submitted prior to completion of the undergraduate degree.    3.

It is recognized that graduate students have very diverse cultural backgrounds.In light of this, the term ethical behavior is defined as conforming to accepted professional standards of conduct, such as codes of ethics used by professional societies in the United States to regulate the manner in which their professions are practiced.The knowledge and practice of ethical behavior shall be the full responsibility of the student.Graduate students may, however, consult with their major professors, department heads, International Graduate Student Services, or the Graduate School for further information on what is expected of them. More specifically, all graduate students, while being affiliated with Virginia Tech, shall abide by the standards established by Virginia Tech, as described in this Constitution.Graduate students, in accepting admission, indicate their willingness to subscribe to and be governed by the Graduate Honor Code and acknowledge the right of the University to establish policies and procedures and to take disciplinary action (including suspension or expulsion) when such action is warranted.',\n",

The fundamental beliefs underlying and reflected in the Graduate Honor Code are that (1) to trust in a person is a positive force in making a person worthy of trust, (2) to study, perform research, and teach in an environment that is free from the inconveniences and injustices caused by any form of intellectual dishonesty is a right of every graduate student, and (3) to live by an Honor System, which places a positive emphasis on honesty as a means of protecting this right, is consistent with, and a contribution to, the University's quest for truth. For additional requirements and further information, please refer to the on-line information on Graduate Honor System and the Honor Code contained on the Virginia Tech Graduate School website at this link. 1.3 Diversity and Inclusion Requirement The ECE Department is committed to fostering a diverse community of faculty, staff, and students.The Virginia Tech Graduate School’s Office of Recruitment, Diversity, and Inclusion focuses on graduate student recruitment and on providing support to students as they get acclimated and adjusted to their graduate programs/certificates through the development of inclusive and diverse programming to meet students' needs.In addition, the ECE Department works closely with the College of Engineering’s Graduate Diversity Programs to help facilitate programs designed specifically for graduate students.More information about the diversity and inclusion efforts at the Graduate School levels may be found on-line at this link. The Graduate School requires all students receiving a graduate degree to satisfy Inclusion and Diversity Requirement.ECE graduate students satisfy this requirement by enrolling and passing the course ENGE 5304, Graduate Student Success in Multicultural Environments (GSSME), which must appear on each ECE graduate student’s plan of study.\",\n",
