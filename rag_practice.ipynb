    "### RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) practice \n",
    "- Retrieval -Find relevant information given a query\n",
    "- Augmentation -Take the relevant information from retrieval and augment our input(prompt) to an LLM with that relevant information.\n",
    "- Generation - Take the first two steps and pass them to an LLM for generative outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why RAG?\n",
    "- The main goal of RAG is to improve the generation outputs of LLMs. \n",
    "- Most of what I practiced were based on fine-tuning. It can provide up-to-date information to the model with less efforts.\n",

       "  'text': \"7  1.2 Virginia Tech Graduate Honor Code    The Graduate Honor Code establishes a standard of academic integrity. As such, this code  demands a firm adherence to a set of values. In particular, the code is founded on the concept  of honesty with respect to the intellectual efforts of oneself and others. Compliance with the  Graduate Honor Code requires that all graduate students exercise honesty and ethical behavior  in all their academic pursuits at Virginia Tech, whether these undertakings pertain to study,  course work, research, extension, or teaching.  It is recognized that graduate students have very diverse cultural backgrounds. In light of this,  the term ethical behavior is defined as conforming to accepted professional standards of  conduct, such as codes of ethics used by professional societies in the United States to regulate  the manner in which their professions are practiced. The knowledge and practice of ethical  behavior shall be the full responsibility of the student. Graduate students may, however, consult  with their major professors, department heads, International Graduate Student Services, or the  Graduate School for further information on what is expected of them.  More specifically, all graduate students, while being affiliated with Virginia Tech, shall abide by  the standards established by Virginia Tech, as described in this Constitution. Graduate  students, in accepting admission, indicate their willingness to subscribe to and be governed by  the Graduate Honor Code and acknowledge the right of the University to establish policies and  procedures and to take disciplinary action (including suspension or expulsion) when such action  is warranted. Ignorance shall be no excuse for actions which violate the integrity of the  academic community.  The fundamental beliefs underlying and reflected in the Graduate Honor Code are that (1) to  trust in a person is a positive force in making a person worthy of trust, (2) to study, perform  research, and teach in an environment that is free from the inconveniences and injustices  caused by any form of intellectual dishonesty is a right of every graduate student, and (3) to live  by an Honor System, which places a positive emphasis on honesty as a means of protecting  this right, is consistent with, and a contribution to, the University's quest for truth.   For additional requirements and further information, please refer to the on-line information on  Graduate Honor System and the Honor Code contained on the Virginia Tech Graduate School  website at this link.  1.3 Diversity and Inclusion Requirement  The ECE Department is committed to fostering a diverse community of faculty, staff, and  students. The Virginia Tech Graduate School’s Office of Recruitment, Diversity, and Inclusion  focuses on graduate student recruitment and on providing support to students as they get  acclimated and adjusted to their graduate programs/certificates through the development of  inclusive and diverse programming to meet students' needs. In addition, the ECE Department  works closely with the College of Engineering’s Graduate Diversity Programs to help facilitate  programs designed specifically for graduate students. More information about the diversity and  inclusion efforts at the Graduate School levels may be found on-line at this link.  The Graduate School requires all students receiving a graduate degree to satisfy Inclusion and  Diversity Requirement. ECE graduate students satisfy this requirement by enrolling and passing  the course ENGE 5304, Graduate Student Success in Multicultural Environments (GSSME),  which must appear on each ECE graduate student’s plan of study.\"},\n",

In addition, all ECE graduate students are expected to  uphold the Virginia Tech Principles of Community and the Graduate School’s Expectations for  Graduate Education as well as the scholarly integrity and research ethics standards of their  disciplines. To satisfy this requirement, ECE graduate students must:  •  Attend the mandatory ECE Graduate Student Orientation held for their first semester of  enrollment as an ECE graduate student  •  Enroll and pass the fall semester of ECE 5944, Graduate Seminar  •  Successfully complete the NSF Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) requirement  as implemented at Virginia Tech.  Additional details on the ECE requirements for satisfying the Scholarly Ethics and Integrity  training requirement is given at the Graduate School’s website at this link.    1.5 Expectations for Graduate Education    The ECE Department supports the Virginia Tech Graduate School’s expectations for graduate  students, graduate program faculty, academic departments and programs, and the Graduate  School at Virginia Tech across all the university's campuses. The ECE Department is committed  to ensuring that these expectations are upheld by all. The Virginia Tech Graduate School’s  expectations document is available at this link.  1.6 Graduate Ombudsperson  The Ombudsperson for the Graduate School helps members of the Graduate School community  engage in and manage conflict in a constructive way. More information about the Graduate  Ombudsperson may be found at this link.  1.7 Conflict Resolution for ECE Graduate Students  If an ECE graduate student encounters a problem or a concern that cannot be resolved with  their advisor, or in an ECE course (e.g., a grading issue), or with interactions within their  research group, there is a “chain of command” to follow. This chain of command should be  followed to help in the resolution of conflict or outstanding issues that may arise as part of your  graduate education within ECE at Virginia Tech. The order is the following:  1. Your first point of contact is your academic advisor  2. The second point of contact is the ECE Graduate Program Director  3. If and only if you are unable to resolve your concern with (1) and (2), the third point of  contact within ECE is the ECE Department Head  4. Issues or concerns not resolved by consulting these three ECE points of contact should  be brought to the Dean of the Graduate School  5. In parallel with consulting the Graduate School Dean, for an independent advocate, you  may also contact the Graduate School Ombudsperson.\"},\n",

The Graduate  Advising Office will not proceed with the requested change without such approval. A change of  degree program can be requested only after the first semester of enrollment and the student  must have at least 9 graded course credit hours and a minimum 3.3 overall GPA. Note that  Graduate School policy allows a student to change graduate degree only once. M.S. thesis and  Ph.D. students funded at any time by a Graduate Teaching Assistantship (GTA) are not eligible  to change to the M.Eng. or M.S. non-thesis degree. M.S. thesis and Ph.D. students funded by a  Graduate Research Assistantship (GRA) must have faculty advisor’s approval to the M.Eng. or  M.S., Non-thesis, degree. The Graduate School also requires that change of degree programs  be requested prior the completion of 21 graded course credit hours. Detailed information on  changing from any ECE Master’s degree to another ECE graduate degree is given here.  1.9 Petitions to the ECE Graduate Committee   This ECE Graduate Policy Manual includes the policies and procedures for ECE graduate  degree programs. In exceptional cases, a student may have legitimate reasons for deviating  from these general requirements. In such cases, the student may submit a petition to the ECE  Graduate Committee to request special consideration.   1.10 Minimum Registration for Students on Assistantships  All graduate students who are supported by a teaching or research assistantship must be  enrolled for some combination of coursework, research, or independent study totaling at least  12 credit hours during the semester they are funded.  1.11 English Proficiency for Teaching Assistants   The duties of graduate teaching assistants in ECE often include direct instructional contact.  Therefore, international students whose native language is not English may have to pass an  English Speaking Proficiency Evaluation in order to be eligible for a graduate teaching  assistantship in ECE. More information is available at this link.  1.12 Immigration Advising  International students should consult directly with Cranwell International Center for guidance  related to: Immigration: I-20/Visa immigration documents; maintaining immigration status; CPT  and OPT applications; and reduced credit enrollment. For more information, consult the on-line  resources available at this link.   1.13 ECE Graduate Student Forms and their Submission    ECE graduate students must obtain department-level approval on all requests and forms that  are submitted to the Virginia Tech Graduate School.

The M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs are offered through the Blacksburg campus as well as the  extended campus consortia (National Capital Region, Northern Virginia Center, Falls Church,  Virginia; Central; Hampton Roads; Western; Virtual; and VT-MENA through Alexandria and  Cairo, Egypt). The M.Eng. degree is offered at the National Capital Region (NCR) and Virtual  campuses.  The ECE Department offers both an M.S., Thesis, and an M.S., Non-Thesis, degree. For the  M.S., Thesis, degree, each plan of study is developed by the student in consultation with his or  her faculty advisor satisfying the M.S., Thesis, degree requirements and the defense of a thesis.  The M.S., Non-Thesis, degree is a coursework-based master’s degree. The M.Eng. degree is a  professionally-oriented degree that offers graduate students a strong academic foundation in  core ECE technological areas with a culminating, project-based learning experience.  The Ph.D. is the highest academic degree awarded by the university and is conferred upon  students who demonstrate outstanding original scholarship during advanced study. It signifies  that the student can conduct independent research and has both a broad basic knowledge of all  areas of the field and a comprehensive knowledge of one area. Students applying for the Ph.D.  program typically have a master’s degree from an accredited college or university in EE, CPE,  or a related field.  A direct-Ph.D. option is available for students without an earned master’s degree. These  students will earn an M.S., Thesis, or an M.S., Non-Thesis, degree in addition to the Ph.D.  degree.  2.2 Admission to the M.S. and Ph.D. Degree Programs    Admission to the M.S., Ph.D., or Direct Ph.D. programs requires the submission of the following  materials:  •  Completion of the on-line application found at the Graduate School website   •  An up-to-date, electronic copy of all official transcript(s) must be submitted with the on- line application; please do not mail your official transcripts to the Graduate School until  you have received an offer of admission from Virginia Tech  •  Three (3) on-line letters of recommendation from people familiar with the student's  academic and/or work background  •  The Graduate Record Exam (the GRE general test including the verbal, quantitative, and  writing) is optional for all applicants; however, applicants with a lower GPA, or from a  school from which Virginia Tech ECE may not be familiar, may benefit from providing  strong GRE scores  •  The TOEFL or IELTS exam is required for applicants not earning a degree from an  accredited university where English is the language of instruction  •  A resume and a statement of purpose submitted with the on-line application  •  A nonrefundable application fee of $75.00.\"},\n",

Grade Point Average (GPA) requirements for admission status are generally higher than  for electrical and computer engineering graduates.    Students from programs such as physics, mathematics, computer science, engineering (other  than electrical or computer), and other programs usually lack background in areas of work  required of electrical and computer engineering students.    Each student's remedial course requirements must be assessed on an individual basis. The  exact nature of courses which a student may need should be decided by the student and his or  her interim advisor. Students crossing from CPE to EE or EE to CPE may also require additional  undergraduate (or MS level) course work. Typical needs are the following:      BACHELOR'S DEGREE  BACKGROUND  TYPICAL REQUIRED COURSE WORK GROUPS  (SEE TABLES BELOW FOR COURSES RELATED TO  EACH GROUP.)  EE  CPE  Non-ECE (Engineering)  B & C  C  Physics  C  C  Mathematics  B & C  C  Computer Science  A (less Stat 4714), B, & C  A (less Stat 4714) & C  Non-Engineering, Non-Physics, Non-Math A, B, & C  A & C    Background courses will not apply toward the EE or CPE graduate degree. However, these courses, if  taken at Virginia Tech, will be counted by the Graduate School toward a student's overall grade point  average (GPA). These courses may be taken concurrently with graduate level EE/CPE courses,  assuming prerequisites are met.    Students seeking a graduate degree in ECE with a bachelor’s degree in a discipline other than EE or  CPE (or changing from EE to CPE or CPE to EE) should have or obtain a background equivalent to the  following Virginia Tech undergraduate courses.\"}]"

The successful completion of the research at the Ph.D. level  culminates in the Ph.D. Dissertation. This document is intended to summarize the execution and  the results of the research effort in complete detail. The dissertation should be an expose of a  problem that demonstrates the expertise of the writer, not simply a problem solution. Aspects  which should be addressed include:  1. Originality of work  2. Significance of contribution  3. Ability to explain essence (not necessarily detail emphasis) of work and fundamental  relationships to related work.  The goal is to demonstrate the student's expertise, not that of the advisor or other authors. The  dissertation is a vehicle to an end, not the end itself. The writing style, grammar and spelling in  the Ph.D. Dissertation should reflect a high level of skill in written communication. The student  and the Ph.D. advisory committee bear complete responsibility for the style of the Ph.D.  dissertation as well as the technical accuracy of the reported results. The dissertation should be  submitted to the advisory committee in hard copy, unless the committee requests another form.  The final submission to the Graduate School must be done electronically.    5.12 The Final Oral Ph.D. Examination    It is the responsibility of the student to allow all members of his or her Ph.D. advisory committee  ample time to have input into the dissertation research proposal and to closely examine the  Ph.D. dissertation to judge the creativity and adequacy of the research work. Therefore, nine  months must lapse after the Ph.D. Preliminary Examination before the final dissertation defense  shall take place and not until after the student has had an opportunity to discuss the details of  the research work with all members of the committee.    All students must schedule a final oral exam with the Graduate School to satisfy university  requirements. An oral final examination consisting of a dissertation defense must be passed.  The exam must be scheduled through the Virginia Tech Graduate School at least two (2) weeks  in advance via ESS.     Copies of the final draft of the dissertation, with all results and major conclusions, must be made  available to all members of the Ph.D. advisory committee at least two weeks prior to the  scheduled date for the final dissertation defense. At the same time, the student must submit to  his or her Faculty Advisor the final hard copy draft of a technical paper based on the dissertation  research. This paper must be suitable for publication in an appropriate professional journal.    The final oral Ph.D. examination is mainly a defense of the dissertation with respect to the  following criteria:  1. Originality of content  2. Importance of the problem considered  3. Method of solution and/or analysis  4. Achievement of research objectives  5. Clarity of presentation.\"},\n",

All campus buildings  have wireless connection which provides internet access throughout the Virginia Tech campus.    All graduate students should obtain a university e-mail account (PID) through Hokie Spa as  soon as possible. Many important departmental announcements are made via e-mail, such as  seminar notices. E-mail should be checked daily in order to receive these announcements in a  timely manner. E-mail may be read from computers in the university computer labs as well as  several sites within the department. All departmental information is distributed by e-mail.    Once their Virginia Tech PID is set up, graduate students may create an account for access to  the ECE Computer Workstation Lab. The workstations offer many computational tools for  graduate students that may be used in their classes or research.  3.6.2 ECE Graduate Student Mailing List  ECE Graduate Student Services maintains a google mailing list for general communication with  ECE graduate students. The mailing address for this list is: ecegrad-g@vt.edu, all currently  enrolled ECE graduate students are included in this list. ECE graduate students should pay  close attention to announcements posted to this mailing list—they are often important, including:  open GRA positions and GTA opportunities; graduate student policy changes, deadlines, and  other important notifications; and employment opportunities. People able to post to this list are:  ECE Graduate Student Services and ECE Graduate Student Association (GSA)  representatives. If you have general information that you feel should be communicated to all  ECE graduate students, email this request to ECE Graduate Student Services.  3.6.3 Study Desks  The ECE Department provides desks in Whittemore Hall, Durham Hall, Torgersen Hall, and  other locations, for as many students as resources permit. GTAs may use, on a shared basis,  desks in several rooms which are dedicated for that purpose. Alternatively, GTAs who have  teaching responsibilities in various laboratories may use desks in those labs if desks are  available. Except for the dedicated GTA desks, all other student study desks are reserved for  GRA use and are under the control of laboratory, center, or research group directors. Any  student seeking use of a desk should see their faculty advisor for further information. All desk  assignments are temporary and are reviewed for continuation at least annually. All graduate  student offices are to always remain locked. Food products (other than packaged snack-type  items) are not to be left in any graduate student office. Usage of tobacco or alcohol products are  not permitted anywhere in Virginia Tech buildings.'}]"
